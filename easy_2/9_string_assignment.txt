Take a look at the following code:

  name = 'Bob'
  save_name = name
  name = 'Alice'
  puts name, save_name

What does this code print out? Think about it for a moment before continuing.

The code prints:
  Alice
  Bob

look at something a bit different:

  name = 'Bob'
  save_name = name
  name.upcase!
  puts name, save_name

What does this print out? Can you explain these results?
  name and save_name are pointing to the same string. When upcase! is applied,
  it mutates the orignal string and now name and save_name are pointing the upcase version of 'Bob'. Thus, what is printed is:
  BOB
  BOB
